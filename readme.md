#![Thalmic Labs Take Home Challenge](/src/images/thlabsblack.jpg?raw-true)

This is a project for the Take Home Challenge for Thalmic Labs Interview. This project is made with React, Redux and Sass technologies.


## Install

This project is build with Webpack and ReactJS. In order to utilize the project, some tools are needed. First is needed to have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your PC. After this, the PC will have installed the Node Packet Manager (NPM) to install node dependencies for the project. Just need to run:
```
$ npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies.

## Running It
This project has been developed with Webpack. The project can be run with the command:
```
$ npm run dev
```
*This will create a local web server from [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) and a browser tab will open. In case that you're not able to see the tab of your browser, you should check the following url:
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This method runs everything on Development mode, but it's still usable. Another way to run it is via through the following command:
This project has been developed with Webpack. The project can be run with the command:
```
$ npm run serve
```
This is a smapp express application, with the bare minimum just to show the deployment on a server. Again, the browser should open automatically, but if that's not the case just visit the following link
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
